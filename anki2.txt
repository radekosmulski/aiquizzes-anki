Refactoring - the act of iteratively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRYing</a> up your code and making it easier to understand and reuse.<br><br><a href='https://aiquizzes.com/questions/72'>view answer on aiquizzes</a>
What do you need to call on an <code>nn.Module</code> to export its parameters, registered buffers, etc to a dictionary of values?	You need to call <code>module.state&#95;dict()</code>. You can then save it using <code>torch.save</code>. Modules support loading of state using <code>load&#95;state_dict</code><br><br><a href='https://aiquizzes.com/questions/73'>view answer on aiquizzes</a>
What is a very important aspect that is often overlooked when doing transfer learning? What is one of the main culprits of getting weird results in this scenario?	BatchNorm! If we freeze entire modules of our model, the layers have been trained to work with inputs of some mean and standard deviation, but these are no longer the inputs they are getting! The way to correct this is, anytime you are doing partial layer training, is to fine tune the BatchNorm layers on our new data.<br><br><a href='https://aiquizzes.com/questions/74'>view answer on aiquizzes</a>
What are Jeremy Howard&#39;s tips for debugging deep learning?	<ul> <li>do not make mistakes in the first place</li> <li>the only way to achieve the above, is making your code so simple that it is very unlikely to contain a mistake</li> <li>check every intermediate result to make sure it does not have a mistake</li> </ul> <br><br><a href='https://aiquizzes.com/questions/75'>view answer on aiquizzes</a>
What is a scientific journal?	It is a way to track what you are doing and the results you are getting. The great scientists of the past all maintained a scientific journal. This way they could pinpoint and follow up on things that were odd. Oftentimes this leads to just fiddling around, but sometimes it will lead you to breakthrough discoveries.<br><br><a href='https://aiquizzes.com/questions/76'>view answer on aiquizzes</a>
What are the two activation functions used inside the LSTM cell? What happens to the input after it gets multiplied with the weight matrix?	The two activation functions are simgoid and tanh. The input, after multiplication with the weights matrix, gets added to the hidden state from the earlier time step (the hidden state also gets multiplied with a weight matrix first). The result then gets separated into four different pieces which follow different paths (play different roles) inside the cell.<br><br><a href='https://aiquizzes.com/questions/77'>view answer on aiquizzes</a>
